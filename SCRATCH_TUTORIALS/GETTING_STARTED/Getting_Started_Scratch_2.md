## Making Felix Move
Make sure that you are in the ![Motion menu block](Images/Motion_Menu.png) menu on the left hand side. Drag the ![Move 10 steps block](Images/move_10_steps.png) block into the coding area on the right.

Click on the block to make Felix move.

Well done you have programmed Felix the cat to move 10 steps.

## Lets Add Sound
Click on the ![Sound menu block](Images/Sound_Menu.png) menu on the left. Drag the ![Play drum block](Images/play_drum.png) and attach it to the ![Move 10 steps block](Images/move_10_steps.png) your code should now look like this ![Code block 1](Images/code_block_1.png)

Click on the blocks and listen.

You can experiment by clicking on the dropdown arrow and selecting a different drum sound.

## Make Felix Dance
Go back to the ![Motion Menu](Images/Motion_Menu.png) menu. Drag another ![Move 10 steps block](Images/move_10_steps.png) block and attach it underneath the ![Play drum block](Images/play_drum.png) block. Click at the start of the 10 and add a minus (-) sign. Your code should now look like this ![Code block 2](Images/code_block_2.png)

Click on the block of code and see what happens.

Go back to the ![Sound menu block](Images/Sound_Menu.png) menu and add another ![Play drum block](Images/play_drum.png) block and attach it to the very bottom of your code block and pick a different drum sound. Your code should now look like this ![Code block 3](Images/code_block_3.png)

Click on the block of code to run it.

## Making The Code Repeat
Click on the ![Control menu block](Images/Control_Menu.png) menu. Drag a ![Repeat block](Images/Repeat_block.png) block and drop it at the top of your code making it wrap around all the other blocks like this ![Code block 4](Images/code_block_4.png)

Click on the block of code to run it. You should see the code run 10 times then stop.

## Make Felix Talk
Click on the ![Looks menu block](Images/Looks_Menu.png) menu. Click and drag a ![Say block](Images/Say_Block.png) block and place it below the repeat block of code you created earlier. Your code should now look like this ![Code block 5](Images/code_block_5.png)

Click the code to see what happens.

Now move the ![Say block](Images/Say_Block.png) to the top of the repeat block of code. Now your code should look like this ![Code block 6](Images/code_block_6.png)

Click on the code to see how it has changed.   

## Using The Green Flag
Click back to the ![Events menu block](Images/Events_menu.png) menu. Drag the ![Green flag clicked block](Images/Green_Flag_Clicked.png) block and attach it at the top of your block of code. Your code should now look like this ![Code block 7](Images/code_block_7.png)

Now click on the ![Green flag icon](Images/Green_Flag.png) above Felix to run your code.

## Lets Make Felix Change Colour
Click on the ![Looks menu block](Images/Looks_Menu.png) menu. Click and drag ![Change colour block](Images/Change_Colour.png) block to the coding area. Your code should now look like this ![Code block 8](Images/code_block_8.png)

Now click the ![Change colour block](Images/Change_Colour.png) to see what happens.

## Using The Keyboard
Click on the ![Events menu block](Images/Events_menu.png) menu. Click and drag the ![Space pressed block](Images/Space_Pressed.png) block and attach it to the top of the ![Change colour block](Images/Change_Colour.png) block. Your code should now look like this ![Code block 9](Imaes/code_block_9.png)

Now press the spacebar.

Experiment by choosing different keys from the dropdown menu.

## Adding A Background
We are now going to add a background to the stage. To do this click on the ![Stage icon](Images/stage_icon_2.png) icon. Now click on the backdrops tab at the top of the code area ![Menu 1](Images/menu_1_2.png) next click on import ![Menu 2](Images/menu_2_2.png) choose any backdrop that you like.

Well done you have now created a new backdrop.

## Adding A New Sprite
Every object that is displayed on the stage is called a sprite.

To create a new sprite click on one of the following icons:

![Create own icon](Images/create_own_2.png) Create your own sprite.

![From file icon](Images/from_file_2.png) Choose sprite from file.

![Upload file](Images/Upload_file.png) upload your own sprite from file.

![From Camera](Images/From_camera.png) Upload a new sprite using the camera on a laptop.

For now click on ![From File](Images/from_file_2.png) and choose a new sprite.

Well done you now have a new sprite to program.

You have just learned the basics of scratch. go and explore and make something cool.
