## RaspiKidd is the proud owner and co founder of [micro:mag](https://micromag.cc)

### Imagine being able to program a computer that you can pick up and put in your pocket?
No matter what age you are or how terrified you are of IT, RaspiKidd offers a service that will bring you up to speed in no time at all, through the use of Raspberry Pi computers and BBC micro:bit micro controllers. 

### You maybe wondering what a Raspberry Pi is? 
If like me, your mouth starts to watering, forget it. NO! you can't eat it. Its not a Raspberry pie :)

A Raspberry Pi is a small but powerful credit card sized computer that retails between £25-£35 and is manufactured within the UK.(see image above) This microcomputer really packs a punch! Not only does it link up with the outside world you can program it to do all sorts of cool things, for example robotics, program games such a MineCraft and impress your friends by using it to turn lights on and off,(insert short video of LED turning on and off here) the list is endless! Not only that you will know your HDMI port - from your USB ports after participating in our short courses - Yes YOU will build this beauty from scratch and what's more, you will understand how it all works :)


### What is a micro:bit?
A micro:bit is a small micro-controller that was developed to increase digital skills among British youngsters as there is a significant digital skills shortage within the country.

The micro:bit itself is a small device measuring 4 by 5 cm, but that small board is packed with features like a 5 x 5 LED display, a compass, accelerometer, two buttons, Bluetooth Low-Energy antenna which allows the micro:bit to interact with a smartphone or laptop. The micro:bit also has 20 GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins which can be accessed by the use of crocodile clips or by inserting the micro:bit into a special connector which you can can find on various accessories like robots.
