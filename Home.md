RaspiKidd is to help anyone who wants to learn how to program, whether you are young or old why not have a go. I specifically teach people how to code using Raspberry Pi's partly because they are affordable and partly because you can link them to the outside world through the GPIO pins, which can be used to turn LED's on and off or integrated into robotics. You can even learn how to program using MineCraft.

I aim to teach anyone that wants to learn. Whether you are unemployed and looking to gain new skills or a parent who has kids that love to code why not come along and learn with them.
