# One Line Installers

Here is a list of programs that I use while coding and how to install them.

## EduBlocks
**Edublocks is a block based programming language making the transition between scratch and python easier.**

```
curl -sSL get.edublocks.org | bash
```

## Visual Studio code (run as super user)
**Is the code editor I use to write tutorials and code. I use it because I can use it on a raspberry pi and Windows computer.**

```
sudo -s
. <( wget -O - https://code.headmelted.com/installers/apt.sh )
```

## Scrot
**Scrot is a handy command line tool for taking screenshots on Linux systems. it is particularly handy on a Raspberry Pi that doesn't have a built in screenshot system.**

```
sudo apt install scrot
```
