# Introducing EduBlocks

He has opened [EduBlocks](http://edublocks.org/) up to the Raspberry Pi community, so he gets lots of feedback on how he can improve things, as well as other developers helping him convert python libraries into [EduBlocks](http://edublocks.org/) code. As well as people like me who have started using it for education and writing tutorials for [EduBlocks](http://edublocks.org/).

So, [EduBlocks](http://edublocks.org/) is a block based program written in [blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/overview) for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). [EduBlocks](http://edublocks.org/) is real python code in block format like Scratch, making the transition from Scratch to Python easier.

I jumped on the bandwagon last year when I seen [EduBlocks](http://edublocks.org/) getting used in a tutorial session at [MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/) within the youth zone ran by [@all_about_code](https://twitter.com/all_about_code) and thought this is something I can use. So after speaking to [@all_about_code](https://twitter.com/all_about_code) at [MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/) and finding out what his plans were I told him to let me know if there is any way I can help.

So far I have contributed by trying to get more people using it by running sessions [@DundeeRjam](https://twitter.com/DundeeRjam) and about to run some at a local [code club as well](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/). I am also running a Session at [MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/) this year using [EduBlocks](http://edublocks.org/). (more to come on that later)

Go and checkout the getting started tutorial that is up at the minute, there will be LED tutorials getting added within the next week.


Thanks for reading and remember Keep having FUN while LEARNING!
