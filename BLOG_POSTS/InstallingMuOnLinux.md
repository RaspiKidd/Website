Mu is a simple code editor developed in Python for Python. Mu has built-in support for Adafruit Circuit Playground Express and the micro:bit. Mu runs on Windows, Mac, Linux and even the Raspberry Pi.

Each Linux distro is a bit different, so for this guide, I am going to focus on Ubuntu.

1. Mu requires Python3. You can check and see if you have Python3 installed by typing:
```
python3 --version
```
If nothing is displayed type:
```
sudo apt install python3
```
to install Python3.

2. You also need pip3 installed type:
```
pip3 --version
```
If it shows nothing you need to install pip3 by typing:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

3. Finally to install Mu type:
```
pip3 install mu_editor
```
4. You can now run Mu from the command line by typing:
```
Mu
```

Now that you have Mu installed you can go and develop in Python3, Micro Python for micro:bit or even CircuitPython for the adafruit Circuit Playground Express.
