# On The Road To MozFest 2017

This is going to be a weekly diary leading up to MozFest 2017.

## Week 1: 01.10.17 - 07.10.17

Throughout this week I have completed my blog post which can be found here [I'm Going to MozFest 2017](http://www.raspikidd.com/i-going-mozfest-2017) This is something every facilitator at MozFest is asked to do.

I have also started writing the Quick Reaction Game worksheet and trying out the code to make sure everything works. This involved creating the electronic circuit ![Electronic circuit](Images/QuickReaction.png) with an Electronic breadboard, an LED, 2 x push buttons, a resistor and Male to Female jumper wires to connect the components to the Raspberry Pi.

So far everything is going to plan.

Throughout the next week I will be adding more functionality to the worksheet by adding user input. Once this is done the worksheet will be complete.

The next steps are to create the presentation and read the worksheet over and make necessary changes.

Come back next week for the Next update.
