# I am going to MozFest2017!!!!!

[MozFest 2017](https://mozillafestival.org/) is less than a month away. As some of you are aware I attended MozFest last year as a volunteer helping out within the youth zone, well I am going back this year as a facilitator running a session called Quick reaction game within the youth zone. I am really looking forward to going back.

The main focus of the festival this year is Internet Health and one of the key areas is Digital Inclusion. This is really important to me because coming from Scotland I am just now seeing some computer Science coming back into the School curriculum unlike England has been doing Computer Science for a few years. The way technology is growing and changing it is important that everyone has access to learning about digital technology and how it is evolving otherwise they are at a huge disadvantage.

My session fits into Digital Inclusion by teaching a wide age range of people about programming physical components like LEDs and Buttons through a Raspberry Pi and [Edublocks](http://edublocks.org/). The session differs from others like it by being able to cover a wider age range and coding ability of the participants due to using [Edublocks](http://edublocks.org/) instead of [Python](https://www.python.org/) which is what most session like this are coded in. By opening this session up to a wide age group I hope to inspire some new young coders to carry on coding and experimenting with technology after MozFest.

## What is The Quick Reaction Game?

The quick reaction game consists of an electronic breadboard, 2 push buttons/tactile switches an LED all connected to a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) so you can program the components and make the game. Participants will be programming the components through [EduBlocks](http://edublocks.org/)

## Why Should You Attend My Session?

If you have been learning [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) for a few years and looking to challenge yourself but think [Python](https://www.python.org/) is out of your depth well this is the session for you. As well as getting to build a simple electronic circuit you will be programming it through [Edublocks](http://edublocks.org/), which is [Python](https://www.python.org/) code in block format like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).

### Hope to see you there!
