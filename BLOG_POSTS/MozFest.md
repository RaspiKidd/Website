# I am going to MozFest2017!!!!!

[MozFest 2017](https://mozillafestival.org/) is less than a month away. As some of you are aware I attended MozFest last year as a volunteer helping out within the youth zone, well I am going back this year as a facilitator running a session called Quick reaction game within the youth zone. I am really looking forward to going back.

The main focus of the festival this year is Internet Health and one of the key areas is Digital Inclusion. This is really important to me bacause coming from Scotalnd I am just now seeing some computer Science coming back into the School ciriculum unlike England has been doing Computer Science for a few years. The way techlology is growing and changing it is important that everyone has access to learning about digital technology and how it is evolving otherwise they are at a huge disadvantage.

My Session this year is about introducing children and parents to programming through making a quick reaction game and programming it through [EduBlocks](www.edublocks.org). This falls under the Digital Inclusion theme by trying to reach more people and teaching them some basic coding skills and hopefully encorage them to carry these skills on after they leave MozFest.

## What is The Quick Reaction Game?

The quick reaction game consists of an electronic breadboard, 2 push buttons/tactile switches an LED all connected to a Raspberry Pi so you can program the components and make the game. Participants will be programming the compnents through [EduBlocks](www.edublocks.org)

## Why Should You Attend My Sesson?

If you have been learning [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) for a few years and looking to challenge yourself but think [Python](https://www.python.org/) is out of your depth well this is the session for you. As well as getting to build a simple electronic circuit you will be programming it through [Edublocks](www.edublocks.org), which is [Python](https://www.python.org/) code in block format like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).

### Hope to see you there!
