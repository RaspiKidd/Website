About two weeks ago I came up with the idea that there should be a community magazine for the micro:bit. I proposed the idea to another two community members who loved the idea and this is where micro:mag was born.

## "micro:mag is the unofficial micro:bit community magazine"

Today (4th of April 2018) seen the official launch of micro:mag and call for contributors. If you would like to write for micro:mag get in touch at [micromag.cc](micromag.cc) or email us at [hello@micromag.cc](hello@micromag.cc).
