# Blinking LED
Within this tutorial we are going to make an LED blink on and off using EduBlocks and a Raspberry Pi.

## Equipment You Will Need

* 1 x red LED
* 2 x male to female jumper wires
* 1 x breadboard
* 1 x 330 ohm resistor
* Raspberry Pi
* keyboard
* Mouse
* SD Card with Raspbian installed
* HDMI cable
* Compatible Screen
* Power Supply

## The Circuit
Lets build the circuit. Make sure you have your LED the right way round. The positive leg is the longer leg on the LED, this is represented by the bent leg in the diagram below:

## Code
The fist thing we need to do is open EduBlocks. do this by double clicking on the ![EduBlocks](Images/EduBlocks.png) desktop icon.

1. Click on the ![Basics menu](Images/Basic.png) and locate the ![Import Edupy](Images/Import_edupy.png) and drag it to the coding area.

2. Click on the ![EduPy menu](Images/EduPy.png) menu. Then click on the ![Kit1 menu](Images/Kit1.png) From here locate the ![Red LED blink block](Images/Red_Blink.png)



Your code should now look like this:
