# About Me

I am a passionate raspberry pi programmer/educator. I love using my raspberry pi to improve my programming skills and
link it with the real world to blink LED’s (*Light Emitting Diode*) or Register button presses. I also like helping other people to learn about
raspberry pi’s and what they can do with them.

I Created this website to share my knowledge and experience with others. I also write my own tutorials which I post here
as well as anything else I find interesting.
